# Chores app

This application was made for the Mobile Application Development assignment.
The idea is to keep track of chores in one household. Firebase is used to store household members and all users. Every time a user completed a chore, they get some trivia about the numbber of total finished chores from the numbersapi (http://numbersapi.com/).
